# raygun4breakpad

Breakpad sample projects for Linux and MacOS to use with Raygun.com.

Each sample is a small code project that integrates with the Breakpad source. When executed, the application crashes and creates a crash dump file (`.dmp`).

Upload the resulting file to Raygun using the `send_minidump.sh` script contained in each sample folder.

## Project structure

- `sampleapp_linux`: Contains Linux sample project
  - `sampleapp_linux/send_minidump.sh`: Code to send dump files to Raygun
- `sampleapp_macos`: Contains MacOS sample project
  - `sampleapp_macos/send_minidump.sh`: Code to send dump files to Raygun
- `deps`: Empty folder to download dependencies (Breakpad)

## Setup

Run the `install_deps.sh` script to pull down the repository dependencies.

### Linux

Build from terminal using the Make file.
`cd sampleapp_linux && make`

### MacOS 

Build from terminal using the Make file.
`cd sampleapp_macos && make`

#### Troubleshooting

If compilation fails with:

```
fatal error: 'mach/ppc/thread_status.h' file not found
```

Open `deps/breakpad/src/client/mac/handler/minidump_generator.h` and remove the following code:

```c
#if !TARGET_OS_IPHONE && (MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED < MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_7)
  #define HAS_PPC_SUPPORT
#endif
```

### Output

Once completed a new directory called 'build' will be generated and contains the following files.
